# Mirmir Roadmaps

The current product direction is **Mirmir Apple-Native Adaptive Video Enhancement Roadmap 1.0.1**, published 2026-07-18 and revised 2026-07-20.

Current phase state: `R00: passed`; `R01: passed`; `R02: in_progress`;
`R03: in_progress`; `R04: in_progress`; `R05: in_progress` under the exact
local-continuation exceptions. R03's bound result remains fail-closed and
`blocked`; R04 is local
implementation only with a commit-bound `diagnostic_only` checkpoint. R04
runtime, hardware, simulator, and operator observations remain `not_observed`;
R05 is preregistered for local implementation only. Phase acceptance is not
claimed.

The complete Markdown roadmap is also published in the root README between stable canonical-roadmap markers. The ASH V3 branch and its testing, partial, failure, and diagnostic evidence are preserved as historical engineering evidence, not as a release.
